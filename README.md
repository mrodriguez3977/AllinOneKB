First attempt at a 100% ortholinear keyboard with g keys

This keyboard uses an ATmega32U4 microprocessor, and the schematic is based on the PJRC Teensy at https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html, The keyboard is designed to be an ortholinear keyboard, but with a few changes can also be turned into a regular keyboard. 
The keyboard supports both micro usb and usb-c.
